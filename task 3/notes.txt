For Loop- used to iterate a part of the program several times.

Initialization:- here we initialize the variable.

Condition:- which is executed each time to test the conditon of the loop. It continues the execution untill the condition is false.

Statement:- statement of the loop executed each time untill the second condition is false.

Increment/Decrement:- It increments or decrements of the variable.

Syntax:-for(initialization;condition,incr/decr){
                statement to be executed
               }

Example:-program to prints table of 1.
public class table1{
           public static void main(String[] args){
                        for(int i=1; i<=10; i++){
                           System.out.println(i);
                 }
          }
